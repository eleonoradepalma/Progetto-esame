      <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/100x200">
      <p>Erika Sorbello is a photographer born in 2000. Her interest in photography started when she was 13, thanks to an old camera belonging to her parents. A few years later, her first real camera arrived.
      After more than 2 years of working, and due to her parentsâ€™ sacrifices, she managed to enroll in IED (European Institute of Design) and attended the Photography Course.
      Right now she is in her last year, and will finish her degree in July.</p>
      <p> Since starting photography, she loves capturing people, especially making them see their own beauty. During her studies she discovered her passion for beauty and editorial portraits. Then she began her first steps in studio photography, and is now also specializing in photo retouching. 
      Over the years she has mastered her skills in events photography such as for fairs, baptisms, parties and weddings. Moreover, she has participated in reportage projects that tell stories about society, humanity, people and culture.</p>
